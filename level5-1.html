                    it comes from water swathed in drops,
                </p>
                <p>
                    it wrinkles and gathers,
                    this planet's skin has to spread out,
                    the sea's whiteness has to be ironed out,
                    and the hands keep moving,
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="two">
                <p>
                    the sacred surfaces get smoothed,
                    and things are done this way
                </p>
                <p>
                    the hands make the world every day,
                    fire conjoins with steel,
                    linen, canvas, and cotton arrive
                    from the scuffles in the laundries,
                    and from light a dove is born:
                </p>
